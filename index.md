## About the Group

We are a research group focused on **geophysical imaging, wave-equation modeling, and seismic inversion**.  
Our research aims to advance quantitative interpretation and subsurface characterization for energy and Earth science applications.

Current topics include:
- Seismic wave propagation and numerical modeling  
- High-resolution imaging and inversion  
- Fracture and anisotropy characterization  
- Data-driven and physics-informed methods  

We welcome motivated students and collaborators with backgrounds in geophysics, applied mathematics, and computational science.
