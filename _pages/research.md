    <h2>Seismic Wave Propagation Mechanisms</h2>
    <p>
      We investigate the physical mechanisms of seismic wave propagation in complex media,
      including anisotropic, attenuative, and heterogeneous formations.
      Our research focuses on accurate wave-equation formulations and numerical schemes
      that capture dispersion, attenuation, and mode conversions.
      These studies provide the theoretical foundation for high-fidelity seismic imaging
      and inversion in challenging geological environments.

    <h2>High-Precision Parameter Modeling and Migration Imaging</h2>
    <p>
      We develop high-precision parameter modeling techniques for velocity, anisotropy,
      and attenuation to support advanced seismic migration imaging.
      By integrating accurate physical models with reverse time migration and
      least-squares imaging, our methods improve resolution and structural fidelity.
      This research is particularly important for complex reservoirs with strong
      heterogeneity and deep burial.

    <h2>Multicomponent Seismic Modeling and Imaging</h2>
    <p>
      Our work on multicomponent seismic data focuses on elastic and anisotropic
      wavefield modeling and imaging.
      We study P- and S-wave propagation, wavefield separation, and vector decomposition
      to fully exploit multicomponent observations.
      These techniques enable more accurate characterization of fractures,
      lithology, and subsurface stress fields.

    <h2>Intelligent Seismic Data Processing</h2>
    <p>
      We explore intelligent seismic data processing methods based on machine learning
      and deep neural networks.
      Our research includes seismic denoising, super-resolution, and data enhancement
      using physics-informed and data-driven approaches.
      By combining wave-equation constraints with learning-based models,
      we aim to improve robustness and generalization in real data applications.

    <h2>Intelligent GPR Modeling and Imaging</h2>
    <p>
      We conduct research on intelligent modeling and imaging methods for ground-penetrating radar (GPR).
      By integrating electromagnetic wave theory with data-driven learning strategies,
      we enhance the resolution and interpretability of GPR imaging results.
      These techniques are applicable to near-surface investigations,
      engineering geophysics, and infrastructure detection.

    <h2>Intelligent Rock Physics and Geothermal / Hot Dry Rock Exploration</h2>
    <p>
      We study intelligent rock physics modeling and geothermal exploration methods,
      including hot dry rock systems.
      Our research combines rock physics theory, geophysical observations,
      and intelligent algorithms to characterize thermal reservoirs.
      These studies aim to support geothermal resource evaluation and
      sustainable energy development.
